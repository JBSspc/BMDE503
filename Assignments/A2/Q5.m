% Q5 Computes the driving-point current for Assignment 2 Q5
%
%    Y = Q5(VEXC) computes the current flowing into terminal 'a' when
%    excited by a voltage source across terminals a-b with the positive
%    side applied to 'a'.
%
%    VEXC is an external driving-point voltage source applied by the system tester.
%    The units of VEXC are volts.
%    The units of Y are amperes.
